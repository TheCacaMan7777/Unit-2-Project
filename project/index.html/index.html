    <h1># System Calculator</h1>
    <p>This document takes a decimal number and turns it into a binary and hexadecimal number.
       For the hexadecimal to be calculate from the decimal, it takes the number you put in the 
       prompt and divides it by 16.
       It results back in a rounded out answer. Then it takes that answer, multiplies it by 16 first,
       and then subtracts it by the number you first input to give us the remainder. With the remainder,
       it'll checks how much it's worth and how it will be translared. The remainder is never more than 15. 
       If it's 1-9, it stays the same. If it's 10-15, it chooses to a respective letter
       between A and F. Finally, the code spits out a hexadecimal! The calculator does this as many times
       as it needs to back a appropriate answer.
